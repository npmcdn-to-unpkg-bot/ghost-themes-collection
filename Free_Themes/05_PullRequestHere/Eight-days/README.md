# 8 Days Theme

8 Days is a custom Ghost theme.

## Getting started

To install, simply download this repo as a zip, extract, and place the 8-days-theme folder in your themes directory. Login to the Ghost CMS backend at `yoursite.com/ghost` with your email and password, go to settings, and select the 8 Days Theme from the dropdown.

## Usage

By default, 8 Days homepage populates via Ghost article tags. It loops through all posts, adding those with the "Blog" and "Gallery" tags to their requisite sections. To add another section based on tags in `loop.hbs`, wrap the code block in a `{{#foreach posts}}` loop and check `{{#has tag="newTag"}}`. You can then access direct properties for each post (e.g. `{{post_class}}`).

## Documentation

If you are new to the Ghost CMS, you can learn more about it here: [https://github.com/tryghost/Ghost](https://github.com/tryghost/Ghost)

Note: the Ghost CMS currently requires standard CSS and does not natively support preprocessors. You'll see an included Sass directory within the assets directory. We used [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) during development. 

Compass runs on any computer that has Ruby installed. If you don't have Ruby installed, you can follow those steps [here](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).

To install Compass type `$ gem install compass` in your terminal window.

Since our project is already setup, navigate to the `assets` diretory and type `$ compass watch`. Now any changes you make in the Sass directory will be compiled and refelcted in the stylesheets directory. Top stop Compass from watching, type `$ ctrl + c`.
