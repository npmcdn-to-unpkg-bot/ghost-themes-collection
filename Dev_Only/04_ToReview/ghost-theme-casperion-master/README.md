It's planned to update this theme consistently depending on Casper theme changes.

### Top pinned navigation bar and off-canvas menu
The top navigation menu bar contains the off-canvas menu button, social media icons and the search button.

### Additional meta tags
Casperion uses additional meta tags for google webmaster tools and twitter.

### GhostHunter
[GhostHunter](https://github.com/i11ume/GhostHunter/) provides Casperion full text searching right in the blog without
having to resort to any third-party solutions, by utilizing the rss feed.

### Google Fonts
[Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts) offers hundreds of free, open-source fonts optimized for the web. Just one
quick step on changing Casperion configuration file and you are ready to have Google Font presented on your blog.

### Google Analytics
Casperion uses the asynchronous [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) tracking code, the fastest and most
reliable tracking code Google Analytics offers.

### FitVids.JS
A lightweight, easy-to-use jQuery plugin for fluid width video embeds, to achieve fluid width videos in your responsive
blog. [FitVids.JS](http://fitvidsjs.com/) support YouTube, Vimeo, Blip.tv, Viddler, Kickstarter, and even your own video vendor.

### Disqus
[Disqus](http://disqus.com/) makes commenting easier and more interactive, while connecting your blog and your
commenters across a thriving discussion community. The Disqus widget for Casperion seamlessly integrates with your blog
post using the Disqus API and is only loaded if the user want it.

### Highlight.JS
[Highlight.js](http://highlightjs.org/) highlights syntax in code examples on Casperion blog. It's very easy to use
because it works automatically: finds blocks of code, detects a language, highlights it. Highlight.js is only loaded if
a code block was detected in blog post.

### Gulp.JS
[Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is an intuitive, code-over-configuration, streaming build system. We use Gulp to build
Casperion theme package and all its related files.

## Development
Don't make any changes in `assets` folder. Only use `src` folder and use `gulp watch` to automatically update assets on changes.

### Change to your needs
Please have a look at the following files to configure this theme to your needs.

* `default.hbs`
* `navigation.hbs`
* files under `partials/all`

### SASS files
The original Casper theme CSS has split in several SASS files.

## Docker
It's very easy to build the assets with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). Make sure you run the Docker container from
the root dir of this source.

```bash
$ docker run --rm -it --volume $(pwd):/app neo9polska/nodejs-bower-gulp npm install
$ docker run --rm -it --volume $(pwd):/app neo9polska/nodejs-bower-gulp gulp
```

### TODO
